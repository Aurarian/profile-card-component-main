## Overview

his is a solution to the [Profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this profile card component above and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The designs are located inside the `/design` folder. In there, both the mobile and desktop versions of the design are found.

### Screenshot

Eventual screenshots of finished work will go here.
